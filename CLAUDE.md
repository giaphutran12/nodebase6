# CLAUDE.md

## Communication Style

- Keep responses concise and simple
- Don't over-explain - the user is a junior dev but learns as they go
- Use short code examples when helpful
- Break down complex concepts into digestible pieces

## Context

- Following a 22hr tutorial building an n8n clone - some concepts will make more sense as the tutorial progresses

## Learning Priority

- **Show, don't do** - For fundamental concepts, gotchas, or important learnings, explain and show how to fix it. Don't auto-fix it.
- Learning is the top priority in this project
- Let the user make the changes themselves to build muscle memory
